For example: 


- 2022-10-20 18:00-19:00 Worked for an hour and tried to recreate colins array that he showed me. Afterwards i started to look up Html/Css and see how i could create the rectangle box for the snake to be in.

- 2022-10-21 I looked up how other people have made the Snake Game to understand more of what i should do. Everyone used "getContext("2d")", which i will try to use

- 2022-10-23 Created a css style rectangle/canvas where the snake will be inside of

- 2022-10-26 Learned how to use fillStyle and fillRect method and used that to paint my canvas and create a lightgreen square box where my snake will appear

- 2022-10-31 Added an upp button that has no use at the moment and will see online how to make it do something whenever i make the snake move. I will try to make code my keyboard inputs first

- 2022-11-04/03 Added functions to the two fillstyles and tried to add a tick system and how much it updates the game every second. i tried setInterval first, but ended up using setTimeout since it says its more flexible online. Will try to use this in how the snake moves... or rather how many squares the snake will move every second/tick

- 2022-11-13 Added a down button and looked at the code/github to refresh my brain since i hadn't coded for a week. I noticed that something had gone wrong and i hadn't sent in anything from the start and i fixed that problem. I also looked up how to add keyboard inputs and tested it with alerts. Everytime the alert comes up it refreshes the ticks "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4416505/how-to-take-keyboard-input-in-javascript"
